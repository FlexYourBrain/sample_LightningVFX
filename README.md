# Lightning VFX - sample project
*(this sample project uses features introduced in defold version 1.7.0 and will not work in previous versions.)*

	Space scrolling shooter VFX where the spaceship fires off lightning at enemies, a mesh
	 is manipulated in real-time stretching from the ship weapons then out into space locking
	 onto an enemy then following the enemy until destroyed, releasing and retracting back to
	 the ship.
